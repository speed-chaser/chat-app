Welcome to the React Native Chat App! This mobile application allows users to engage in real-time chat conversations, customize their chat experience, and send messages, images, and location data. Here's an overview of its features and how to get started.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat:** Engage in real-time chat conversations with other users.
- **Multimedia Messaging:** Send images and share location data within the chat.
- **Offline Data:** The app stores chat data both online using Firebase and offline using AsyncStorage for a seamless user experience.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the React Native Chat App:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have a compatible Node.js version installed (e.g., Node.js 16.19.0).

### 1. Expo CLI Installation

If you don't have Expo CLI installed, you can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### 2. Project Setup

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/speed-chaser/chat-app/
cd chat-app
```

### 3. Dependency Installation

Install project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Expo Account

If you haven't already, create an Expo developer account by visiting [Expo Dev Tools](https://expo.dev/tools). You'll need this account to run your app on Expo Client.

### 5. Start the Development Server

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
expo start
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Expo DevTools interface.

### 6. Running on a Physical Device or Emulator

Running on Android or iOS Emulator:

- Ensure you have an Android emulator or an iOS simulator set up.
- From the Expo DevTools interface, you can start an emulator directly.

Running on Physical Device:

- Install the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device.
- Scan the QR code displayed in the Expo DevTools interface using the Expo Go app (if you're on iOS you can just scan with your default camera).

Now the React Native Chat App should be up and running on your device or emulator.
You can start chatting and explore its features!
